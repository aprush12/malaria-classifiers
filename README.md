A simple CNN classifier and K-means clustering algorithm for malaria diagnostics and research: CS279 Final Project

Authors: Arusha Patil, Ananya Siri Vasireddy, Raina Talwar Bhatia

Our project consists of a supervised learning CNN model that distinguishes healthy cells from parasitized P.falciparum cells and an unsupervised k-means clustering model that categorizes parasitized cells across malaria stages. The main advantages of automating malaria diagnoses are increasing access to rapid testing in remote/resource-limited settings, minimizing human error, potentially leading to more reliable diagnoses, and allowing for outbreak monitoring through real-time data analysis, enabling rapid intervention.
