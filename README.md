A simple CNN classifier and K-means clustering algorithm for malaria diagnostics and research: CS279 Final Project

Our project consists of a supervised learning CNN model that distinguishes healthy cells from parasitized P.falciparum cells and an unsupervised k-means clustering model that categorizes parasitized cells across malaria stages. The main advantages of automating malaria diagnoses are increasing access to rapid testing in remote/resource-limited settings, minimizing human error, potentially leading to more reliable diagnoses, and allowing for outbreak monitoring through real-time data analysis, enabling rapid intervention.

### Authors: Arusha Patil, Ananya Siri Vasireddy, Raina Talwar Bhatia
All authors contributed equally to the project. Arusha developed the supervised learning algorithm, Ananya the unsupervised learning algorithm, and Raina the written components outside of those sections and the evaluation of the k-means clustering algorithm. Guided backpropagation algorithm written with ChatGPT.
